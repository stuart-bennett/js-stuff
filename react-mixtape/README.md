# React Mixtape
A Spotify playlist manager

## Why?
Makes an interesting demo app to build up my React skills

## Getting Started
For local development:
`> yarn run start` - This will start the app on a local webserver with hot module reloading configured

For deployments:
`> yarn run build` - This will build the app into the dist/ directory. You can then choose how you want to deploy the built application.
